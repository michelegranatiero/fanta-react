# Fantagment

An Auction Manager for Fantasy Football. This is a responsive website built with the React framework that exploits the browser local storage.

2 modes are available: Classic and Mantra.

You can import a csv file with players data and manage the auction with your friends.

Assigned players in each team can be sorted in different ways based on their role or purchasing time.

A credit managment system was implemented for the auction, along with a validation system that checks for team credit balance and player role saturation in each team.
